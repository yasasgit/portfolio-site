# Docker Basics

Docker is a powerful tool that helps developers and DevOps engineers build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight containers. If you're just getting started with DevOps or containerization, understanding Docker is essential.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, packaging, and running applications in isolated environments called **containers**. These containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across environments, making deployments more predictable and scalable.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency**: Ensures the same environment in development, testing, and production.
- **Portability**: Runs on any system with Docker installed.
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Isolation**: Keeps applications and dependencies separated.

## Key Concepts

| Term         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image        | A snapshot of a container, including the application and its dependencies. |
| Container    | A running instance of an image.                                             |
| Dockerfile   | A script with instructions to build a Docker image.                         |
| Docker Hub   | A public registry for sharing Docker images.                                |
| Volume       | Used to persist data generated by containers.                               |
| Network      | Allows containers to communicate with each other.                           |

## Basic Docker Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands to get started:

```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx

# Run a container from an image
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# Remove an image
docker rmi nginx
````

## Writing a Simple Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` defines the environment for your application. Here's a basic example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy code files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Build and run your image:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
```

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. Once you grasp the basics, you'll unlock powerful workflows for DevOps, CI/CD, and scalable infrastructure.

In future articles, we'll explore Docker Compose, Docker volumes, and integrating Docker with CI pipelines.
